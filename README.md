## What is Wallonia?
Wallonia is a fictional company using Matter.js to have "blobs" of HTML elements appear on the screen the same as
a Matter.js matter-body would.  
This is an example for the use of Matter.js in websites to make them stand out more.  
Matter.js can be expanded to use HTML elements and letting the user interact with them, opening the door for
grander effects.

## How do I use this on my own website?  

### Quick Explanation:
- Have ready-made HTML elements to be used in combination with the matter-bodies.  
- Loop over the elements and categorize them by class, giving them their unique shape and actions.  
- Continually transform the HTML elements so that they are perfectly on top of the matterbodies and rotate as they would.
